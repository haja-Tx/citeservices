# ACL

`ACL` are now an integral part of [EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle](https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/tree/master)

See the related feature to implement `entity/action role permissions`:
* [#2806](https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/pull/2806)
* [#2810](https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/pull/2810)
* [#2829](https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/pull/2829)

The `ACL` feature have been removed from `EasyAdminPlusBundle` except for the `Export` action (see below).
